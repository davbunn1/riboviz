## Adding new operating system packages

Update 'Install operating system packages' in `docs/user/install.md`:

* Add an entry for the package to the 'Package Links' table.
* Add commands to the 'Install on Ubuntu' and 'Install on CentOS' subsections.
* Add commands to the 'Check packages have installed' subsection.

Add commands to "quick install scripts" (see current content of scripts for what is expected):

* `bash/install-ubuntu.sh`
* `bash/install-centos.sh`
* `bash/environment-tables.sh`, add commands to capture versions of any command-line tools and echo these in a tabular format.

## Adding tools not available as operating system packages

Update 'Install tools not available as operating system packages' in `docs/user/install.md`:

* Add an entry for the package to the 'Package Links' table.
* Add a new subsection describing how to download, build, configure, install and check the package.
* If the new tool needs the `PATH` configured or other environment variables set, then update commands in `setenv.sh` in 'Create `setenv.sh` to configure paths'.

Add commands to "quick install scripts" (see current content of scripts for what is expected):

* `bash/install-tools.sh`, also update commands to create `setenv.sh`, if applicable.
* `bash/environment-tables.sh`, add commands to capture versions of any command-line tools and echo these in a tabular format.
