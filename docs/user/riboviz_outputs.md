# riboviz output files and figures

This document lists the output files from a typical riboviz run, along with short descriptions. When first looking at outputs of a riboviz run, `read_counts_by_length.pdf` and `metagene_start_stop_read_counts.pdf` will be a good starting point for accessing the success of the run and the quality of the data used, as described below. 

**Initial Quality control checks**

When looking at the `read_counts_by_length.pdf`, it is expected to see a peak of reads at 28-31nt. If the adapter or UMI (Unique Molecular Identifiers) sequence given in the config file does not match those used in the experiment irregularities will be present in the output files. If these sequences are incorrect a clear peak at 28-31nt in `read_counts_by_length.pdf` will not be present. In addition, very few reads may be present as they are unable to align to the annotation files so are discarded at an earlier stage of the pipeline. You can examine `read_counts_per_file.tsv` to check the number of aligned reads at each stage of the pipeline. 

When looking at the `metagene_start_stop_read_counts.pdf`, it is expected to see a peak of reads upstream of the start codon, then repeating smaller peaks every 3nt. Severe disruption of the 3nt periodicity indicates a lower quality dataset and potential issues with the adapter sequence or UMI regular expression.

After a riboviz run, many output files are produced within the output directory.
The output directory is specified by the parameter `dir_out` in the YAML configuration file.

There are a few output files that collect information for an entire run.
There are many output files that are specific to each sample, which are organized into a separate subdirectory for each sample. 


# Output files for an entire run


## `TPMs_all_CDS_all_samples.tsv` 

A tsv file with transcripts per million (tpm) for all genes from successfully processed samples. This file is produced by the script `collate_TPMs.R`. This script uses the `ORF_TPMs_and_counts.tsv` file from each processed sample and lists the tpms of each sample for each gene, allowing for comparison between samples. 

```
ORF	ANAPH_1	VEG_1
Q0045	54.5	0.7
Q0050	0.6	0.7
Q0055	0.6	0.1
Q0060	2.2	0.1
Q0065	22.2	1
Q0070	22.8	0.7
```


## `read_counts_per_file.tsv` 

A read counts file (only if `count_reads: TRUE`).

The workflow will summarise information about the number of reads in the input files and in the output files produced at each step of the workflow. This summary is produced by scanning input, temporary and output directories and counting the number of reads (sequences) processed by specific stages of a RiboViz workflow.

The read counts file, `read_counts_per_file.tsv`, is written into the output directory.

The reads counts file is a tab-separated values (TSV) file with the following columns:

* `SampleName`: Name of the sample to which this file belongs. This is
  an empty value if the step was not sample-specific
  (e.g. demultiplexing a multiplexed FASTQ file).
* `Program`: Program that wrote the file. The special token
  `input` denotes input files.
* `File`: Path to file.
* `NumReads`: Number of reads in the file.
* `Description`: Human-readable description of the file contents.

The following information is included:

* Input files: number of reads in the FASTQ files used as inputs.
* `cutadapt`: number of reads in the FASTQ file output.
* `riboviz.tools.demultiplex_fastq`: FASTQ files output by
  "demultiplex_fastq", using the information in the associated
  `num_reads.tsv` summary files, or, if these can't be found, the
  FASTQ files themselves.
* `hisat2`: number of reads in the SAM file and FASTQ file output.
* `riboviz.tools.trim_5p_mismatch`: number of reads in the SAM file
  output as recorded in the `trim_5p_mismatch.tsv` summary file
  output, or the SAM file itself, if the TSV file cannot be found (if
  `trim_5p_mismatches: TRUE`)
* `umi_tools dedup`: number of reads in the BAM file output.

Here is an example of a read counts file produced when running the vignette:

```

# Output files for each sample

For each sample (`<SAMPLE_ID>`), intermediate files are produced in a sample-specific subdirectory (`<SAMPLE_ID>`).


## `<SAMPLE_ID>_output_report.html` 

This output report in .html format contains a provenance section for the sample, all the pdf output files produced by riboviz, and information on any plots not produced such as which files would be needed to produce plots in future runs. The HTML also includes a side bar to allow for navigation between figures. This file is produced by `AnalysisOutputs.Rmd`, which loads and creates all of the output graphs in HTML format.

Example of the top of the HTML file:

<img src="../images/output_images/html_output.jpg" alt="html_output image" width="500"/>

Only output if `run_static_html: TRUE`. 


## `<SAMPLE_ID>.bam` 

BAM file of reads mapped to transcripts, which can be directly used in genome browsers. The BAM file is produced by samtools.


## `<SAMPLE_ID>.bam.bai` 

BAM index file for `<SAMPLE_ID>.bam`. This file is produced by samtools.


## `minus.bedgraph` 

Bedgraph of reads from minus strand (if `make_bedgraph: TRUE`).

Because riboviz aligns to the transcriptome, which represents single-stranded positive-sense RNA, there should be very few reads counted in `minus.bedgraph`. This file is produced by bedtools.


## `plus.bedgraph` 

Bedgraph of reads from plus strand (if `make_bedgraph: TRUE`).

Almost all translated reads should be counted in open reading frames within `plus.bedgraph`, again because riboviz aligns to the transcriptome, which represents single-stranded positive-sense RNA. This file is produced by bedtools.


## `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5` 

Length-sensitive alignments of reads in compressed HDF5 format. This file is created from the sample BAM file using `bam_to_h5.R`.

The HDF5 file, `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5`, has external links to complementary HDF5 files, named `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.1`, `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.2` etc. each of which hold the data for a subset of genes. The number of data files depends on the number of processes (`num_processes`). For example, if `num_processes` is 1 then the output files will be `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5` (external links file) and `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.1` (data file). If `num_processes` is 4 then the output files will be `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5` (external links file) and `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.1`, `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.2`, `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.3`, `<SAMPLE_ID>.h5.4` (data files). For more information, see [Structure of HDF5 data](../reference/hdf5-data.md).

Information contained within the HDF5 file can be accessed using the functions `GetGeneDataMatrix` and `TidyGeneDataMatrix` in R, which will create a tibble showing the number of reads of each length occurring at each position in a gene. More useful functions for working with a HDF5 file are described in `rscripts/read_count_functions.R`.

## `metagene_start_stop_read_counts.tsv`

A tsv file, showing the sum of reads occurring at positions around the start and stop codons for all genes. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step “Check for 3nt periodicity globally”, using functions `CalculateThreeNucleotidePeriodicity` and `WriteThreeNucleotidePeriodicity`. These function produce a table showing the number of reads mapping to each position being investigated, using `AllGenes5StartPositionLengthCountsTibble` and `AllGenes3EndPositionLengthCountsTibble` to extract information from the sample h5 file.

```
Pos	Counts	End
-24	536	5'
-23	426	5'
-22	391	5'
-21	428	5'
-20	398	5'
-19	569	5'
```


## `metagene_start_stop_read_counts.pdf`

A meta feature plot showing the total number of reads present within a 75nt window around the start and stop codons. The reads occurring at each position for each gene are summed to give a total for each position, then plotted. It is expected to see a large peak just upstream of the start codon, due to ribosome binding being the slow step of translation. This is typically followed by regular repeating smaller peaks, known as 3nt periodicity, as the majority of reads will map to the first nucleotide of a codon. If the expected features are not seen, then it is possible that there is a problem with annotation files, the adapter listed in the config files or the dataset used is of low quality. 

Good quality meta feature plot:

Meta feature plot produced using incorrect annotation files:

<img src="../images/output_images/bad_metagene_start_stop_read_counts.jpg" alt="poor quality 3nt_periodicity plot" width="500"/>


## `read_counts_by_length.tsv`

A tsv file showing how many reads are of each length, with the majority being of 28-31nt in length. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step “Distribution of lengths of all mapped reads” using functions `CalculateReadLengths` and `WriteReadLengths` to get the length and number of reads for each gene, then calculate the total number of reads of each length. These functions extract the information from the h5 file. 

```
Length	Counts
10	0
11	0
12	0
13	0
14	0
15	21567
16	42981
```

## `read_counts_by_length.pdf`

A bar chart showing the lengths of the reads detected in the sample. It is expected that the majority of reads will be 28-31nt long if the adapter sequences have been removed correctly. A good file to check first when running a new dataset, as if the reads peak in the expected range then it is a good indication of a successful run. If no reads are detected then it is a clear indication of something going wrong, such as the wrong UMI expression or adapter sequence being used, leading to reads being unable to align to annotation files.

Example read_counts_by_length plot:

<img src="../images/output_images/read_counts_by_length.jpg" alt="poor quality read_counts_by_length plot" width="500"/>


## `nt_freq_per_read_position.tsv`

A tsv file listing the frequency of each different nucleotide at each position of reads of different lengths, including all three possible frames for each read length. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step “Biases in nucleotide composition along mapped read lengths” using functions `CalculateBiasesInNucleotideComposition` and `WriteBiasesInNucleotideComposition`. For each read length, the frequency of each nucleotide being detected at each position is calculated.

```
Length	Position	Frame	A	C	G	T
10	1	0	0	0	0	0
10	2	0	0	0	0	0
10	3	0	0	0	0	0
10	4	0	0	0	0	0
10	5	0	0	0	0	0
10	6	0	0	0	0	0
```

## `metagene_normalized_profile_start_stop.pdf`

A plot that shows the mean number of reads mapping to each position upstream and downstream of the start and stop codon for all genes. It is expected to have a peak at the start codon, with the majority of following positions having a relatively consistent mean that is comparatively low to the mean observed at the start codon. 

Example mean number of reads plot:

<img src="../images/output_images/metagene_normalized_profile_start_stop.jpg" alt="pos_sp_rpf_norm_reads plot" width="500"/>



## `metagene_normalized_profile_start_stop.tsv`

A tsv file listing the mean and standard deviation of a normalised number of reads detected at positions along genes. The positions are from 1 to 500 nt downstream of the start codon and -500 to -1 nt upstream of the stop codon. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step “Position specific distribution of reads” using functions `CalculatePositionSpecificDistributionOfReads` and `WritePositionSpecificDistributionOfReads`, which estimate the mean and standard deviation of the number of mapped reads at specific positions of a meta transcript. 

```

```


## `ORF_TPMs_vs_features.tsv`

A tsv file showing the tpm of a set of features and a value for that feature. The features are:
* Length_log10 (log10 of the gene length)
* uATGs (number of upstream start codons)
* FE_atg (Free Energy at ATG)
* FE_cap (Free Energy at the cap)
* utr (length of the UTR)
* utr_gc (GC content of the UTR)
* polyA (3' polyA tail on mRNA).

This is produced by combining the tpms file with the features file, if a features file is provided. This is done by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step "Correlations between TPMs of genes with their sequence-based features" using the functions `CalculateSequenceBasedFeatures` and `WriteSequenceBasedFeatures`.

```
ORF	tpm	Feature	Value
YAL001C	3.42470723290552	Length_log10	3.06445798922692

## `ORF_TPMs_and_counts.tsv`

A tsv file listing the rpb (reads per base) and tpm of the ORFs of a sample, along with the number of reads detected in the ORF. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during the step “Calculate TPMs of genes” using functions `CalculateGeneTranscriptsPerMillion` and `WriteGeneTranscriptsPerMillion`. These functions get the total number of reads per gene from the h5 file which they use to calculate the rpb and tpm.

## `normalized_density_APEsites_per_codon.pdf` 

This plot shows a range of features and relates them to ribosome densitiy on the A, P and E sites. 4 features are shown; Microarry, RNA.seq, tAI and tRNA. These are taken from the `--t-rna-file` if provided. Each codon codon has a different value for each of these features, described generally here as a tRNA_value. These tRNA_values are plotted against the ribodensity at each site of the ribosome, showing any relationships or trends.

## `metagene_position_length_counts_5start.tsv`

A TSV file containing the number of reads of different lengths mapping to positions around the start codon. This file is created by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step "Check for 3nt periodicity globally" by functions CalculateGenePositionLengthCounts5Start and WriteGenePositionLengthCounts5Start. 

```

```

## `metagene_start_barplot_by_length.pdf`

A meta-feature bar chart showing the number of reads occurring at positions around the start codons of genes, faceted by read length. As the majority of reads will be 28-31nt in length, only bar charts for lengths 26-32nt are shown. It is expected that each length will show a peak of reads just upstream of the start codon for all lengths, and then an observable 3nt periodicity following the peak, which will be more distinct in the more common read lengths. This figure is created as part of `generate_stats_figs.R` step “Check for 3nt periodicity globally”, using data that is saved in the `metagene_position_length_counts_5start.tsv` file. Note: the Y axis scale will vary for each read length.

## `metagene_start_ribogrid_by_length.pdf`

A meta-feature heatmap showing the number of reads occurring at positions around the start codons of genes with the y axis as read length, and the colour intensity showing read count. It is expected that each length will show a peak of reads just upstream of the start codon for all lengths, shown by an intense dark purple, and then an observable 3nt periodicity following the peak, which will be more distinct in the more common read lengths. This figure is created as part of `generate_stats_figs.R` step “Check for 3nt periodicity globally”, using data that is saved in the `metagene_position_length_counts_5start.tsv` file.

## `read_frame_per_ORF.tsv` 

A tsv file showing the count threshold for each frame and the p value comparing the counts in frame 0 to frames 1, 2 and both 1 and 2 for each gene. It is expected that there will be a significant difference between the frames, with the majority of reads mapping to frame 0. Generated by `generate_stats_figs.R` during step “Check for 3nt periodicity (frame) by Gene” using functions `CalculateGeneReadFrames` and `WriteGeneReadFrames`. These functions count the number of reads in each frame and calculates the Wilcoxon rank-sum paired test p-values.

## `read_frame_per_ORF_filtered.tsv`

A tsv file showing the count threshold for each frame and the p value comparing the counts in frame 0 to frames 1, 2 and both 1 and 2 for each gene. It is expected that there will be a significant difference between the frames, with the majority of reads mapping to frame 0. This file is produced by filtering the read_frame_per_ORF.tsv file, keeping only the genes where Ct_fr0 + Ct_fr1 + Ct_fr2 is greater than the count_threshold, which is defined in the config file.

## `frame_proportions_per_ORF.pdf` 

A box plot of the proportion of reads mapping to each nucleotide of a codon for each ORF, with the first codon being denoted as Frame 0, the second being Frame 1 and the 3rd being Frame 2. It is expected that the majority of reads will be mapping to the first nucleotide, Frame 0, so this box will be higher than the others.
