# Configuring the riboviz workflow

This page describes the inputs that the riboviz workflow requires and how it is configured.

---

## Input files

The workflow requires the following inputs (file formats are in brackets).

### Configuration

A configuration file containing all the information required for the workflow, including the locations of the other input files ([YAML](http://www.yaml.org/)). For details, see [Configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters) below.

### Organism data

Transcript sequences containing both coding regions and flanking regions (which could be fixed, or coincident with measured UTRs) (FASTA).

Matched genome feature file  specifying coding sequences locations (start and stop coordinates) within the transcripts (GTF/GFF3).

Ribosomal rRNA and other contaminant sequences to avoid aligning to (FASTA).

Additional organism-specific data, for creating statistics and figures:

* Position of codons within each gene (RData).
* Features to correlate with ORFs (tab-separated values, with `ORF`, `Length_log10`, `uATGs`, `FE_atg`, `FE_cap`, `utr`, `utr_gc`, `polyA` columns).
* tRNA estimates. (tab-separated values, with `AA`, `Codon`, `tRNA`, `tAI`, `Microarray`, `RNA.seq` columns).
* Summary of read frame displacement from 5' end to A-site for each read length based on "standard" yeast data from early ribosome profiling papers (tab-separated values, with `read_length`, `asite_disp` columns).

Ribosome profiling data - one or more files (FASTQ).

### Sample sheet

For processing multiplexed FASTQ files, a sample sheet (tab-separated values with, at least, `SampleID` and `TagRead` (barcode) columns).

### Examples

An example `fq_files` list is:

```yaml
fq_files:
  WTnone: SRR1042855_s1mi.fastq.gz
  WT3AT: SRR1042864_s1mi.fastq.gz
```

An example `multiplex_fq_files` list is:

```
multiplex_fq_files:
- multiplex_umi_barcode_adaptor.fastq
```

Example `umi_regexp` are:

* `^(?P<umi_1>.{4}).+(?P<umi_2>.{4})$` extracts a 4nt UMI from the 5' end of a read and a 4nt UMI from the 3' end.
* `^(?P<umi_1>.{4}).+(?P<umi_2>.{4})(?P<cell_1>.{3})$` extracts a 3nt barcode from the 3' end of a read then extracts a 4nt UMI from the 5' end and a 4nt UMI from the 3' end.
* `^(?P<umi_1>.{4}).+(?P<umi_2>.{5})(?P<cell_1>.{5})$` extracts a 4nt umi from the 5' end, 5nt umi from the 3' end, and a 5nt barcode from the 3' end. This expression is used in the [Favate et al 2021 E. coli example dataset](https://github.com/riboviz/example-datasets/blob/main/bacteria/escherichia/Favate_etal_2021_ltee_translation_multiplexed_CDS_w_25utrs.yaml) and the [Gupta et al 2018 saccharomyces example dataset](https://github.com/riboviz/example-datasets/blob/main/fungi/saccharomyces/Gupta_2018_tRNA_Modification_Carbon_Nitrogen_Metabolism_RPF_9-samples_CDS_w_250utrs_config.yaml).
* `(?P<umi_1>.{8})` extracts an 8nt UMI from the 5' end of the read. This expression is used in the [Weinberg et al 2016 Saccharomyces example dataset](https://github.com/riboviz/example-datasets/blob/main/fungi/saccharomyces/Weinberg_2016_RPF_1_sample_cerevisiae_CDS_w_250utrs_config.yaml).

### Constraints

If `dedup_umis` is `TRUE` but `extract_umis` is `FALSE` then a warning will be displayed, but processing will continue.

If both `fq_files` and `multiplex_fq_files` parameters are provided then the workflow will exit. Only a group of non-multiplexed files or a single multiplexed file can be provided.

If `fq_files` are provided then `umi_regexp` should extract only UMIs (i.e. it should contain `<umi>` elements only).

If `multiplex_fq_files` is provided then `umi_regexp` should extract both barcodes and UMIs (i.e. it should contain both `<cell>` and `<umi>` elements).

While both `codon_positions_file` and `t_rna_file` are optional, either both must be specified or neither must be specified.

## Configuring file paths and directories

The following configuration parameters take values that are absolute or relative paths to files or directories:

* `asite_disp_length_file`
* `codon_positions_file`
* `dir_in`
* `dir_index`
* `dir_tmp`
* `dir_out`
* `features_file`
* `orf_fasta_file`
* `orf_gff_file`
* `rrna_fasta_file`
* `t_rna_file`

To give you flexibility in how and where you locate these input files and directories, both the use of configuration tokens representing environment variables with their paths, and the use of symbolic links are supported. These are described in the following sections.

### Environment variables and configuration tokens

To give you flexibility in how and where you locate these input files and directories, the values for these paths can each include, as a prefix, one of the following three tokens:

* `${RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES}`
* `${RIBOVIZ_ORGANISMS}`
* `${RIBOVIZ_DATA}`

At runtime, these tokens will be replaced with the names of the corresponding environment variables. The environment variables are:

* `RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES`
* `RIBOVIZ_ORGANISMS`
* `RIBOVIZ_DATA`

If a token is present in a value but the corresponding environment variable is undefined, then the path `.` is substituted.

As an example, if your configuration defines:

```
asite_disp_length_file: ${RIBOVIZ_ORGANISM_FILES}/other/yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt
```

and you set an environment variable `RIBOVIZ_ORGANISM_FILES` with value `/home/user/riboviz/example-datasets/fungi/saccharomyces/`, then the value of `asite_disp_length_file` used at runtime is `/home/user/riboviz/example-datasets/fungi/saccharomyces/other/yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt`.

If, however, you leave `RIBOVIZ_ORGANISM_FILES` undefined, then the value of `asite_disp_length_file` used at runtime is `./other/yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt`.

As another example, imagine your input files were laid out as follows:

```console
/home/user/dataset/
  data/
    yeast_codon_pos_i200.RData
    yeast_features.tsv
    yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt
    yeast_tRNAs.tsv
  organisms/
    yeast_rRNA_R64-1-1.fa
    yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
    yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
  samples/
    input/
      SRR1042855_s1mi.fastq.gz
      SRR1042864_s1mi.fastq.gz
```

(as an aside, there is no requirement for these three directories to be colocated under a common `dataset` directory. They can each be located anywhere within your file system)

You could define the following configuration parameters, in `config.yaml` (other configuration parameters have been omitted for brevity):

```yaml
asite_disp_length_file: ${RIBOVIZ_DATA}/yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt
codon_positions_file: ${RIBOVIZ_DATA}/yeast_codon_pos_i200.RData
dir_index: ${RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES}/index
dir_in: ${RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES}/input
dir_out: ${RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES}/output
dir_tmp: ${RIBOVIZ_SAMPLES}/tmp
features_file: ${RIBOVIZ_DATA}/yeast_features.tsv
orf_fasta_file: ${RIBOVIZ_ORGANISMS}/yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
orf_gff_file: ${RIBOVIZ_ORGANISMS}/yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
rrna_fasta_file: ${RIBOVIZ_ORGANISMS}/yeast_rRNA_R64-1-1.fa
t_rna_file: ${RIBOVIZ_DATA}/yeast_tRNAs.tsv
```

Which, if any, token you use in each of the configuration parameters is entirely up to you. No checks are made to see which specific token is used with which configuration parameter.

[Defining values for environment variables](./prep-riboviz-run-nextflow.md#defining-values-for-environment-variables) in [Running the riboviz Nextflow workflow](./prep-riboviz-run-nextflow.md) describes how to define values for these environment variables so that their values can be applied when the workflow is run.

**Note:** If a configuration file contains environment variable tokens then you **must** provide values for these when running the workflow.

**Note:** The following configuration parameters also take values that are relative paths to files or directories, but the use of tokens in their values is **not supported**, as these paths are assumed to be relative to paths defined by the configuration parameters stated above:

* `fq_files`, relative to `dir_in`.
* `multiplex_fq_files`, relative to `dir_in`.
* `orf_index_prefix`, relative to `dir_index`.
* `rrna_index_prefix`, relative to `dir_index`.
* `sample_sheet`, relative to `dir_in`.

### Symbolic links and creating expected directory structures

If a configuration file specifies paths that are relative within the current directory or its descendants (i.e. no absolute paths and no paths to parent directories via `..`), then you can create a directory structure that reflects that expected by the configuration and populate this directory structure with symbolic links to the actual input files, wherever they may be located.

For example, `vignette/vignette_config.yaml` assumes the following structure of directories and files relative to the current directory:

```
data/
  yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
  yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
  yeast_codon_pos_i200.RData
  yeast_features.tsv
  yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt
  yeast_tRNAs.tsv
vignette/
  input/
    SRR1042855_s1mi.fastq.gz
    SRR1042864_s1mi.fastq.gz
    yeast_rRNA_R64-1-1.fa
    yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
    yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
```

So, if you wanted to run the workflow represented by `vignette_config.yaml` in a different directory you could create a directory structure and populate it with symbolic links to the input files. This could be done as follows

**Note:** It is assumed that the `riboviz` directory is in `$HOME` i.e. `$HOME/riboviz`. If your `riboviz` directory is located elsewhere then `$HOME` accordingly.

Create a directory structure matching that represented by `vignette_config.yaml`:

```console
$ cd
$ mkdir -p example
$ mkdir -p example/data
$ mkdir -p example/vignette
$ mkdir -p example/vignette/input
```

Create symbolic links to all the input files, where `$HOME/riboviz` is the path to riboviz home directory, which can be relative to the current directory or absolute:

```console
$ cd example/data
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_codon_pos_i200.RData
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_features.tsv
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_standard_asite_disp_length.txt
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/data/yeast_tRNAs.tsv
$ cd ../vignette/input
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/vignette/input/SRR1042855_s1mi.fastq.gz
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/vignette/input/SRR1042864_s1mi.fastq.gz
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/vignette/input/yeast_rRNA_R64-1-1.fa
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/vignette/input/yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.fa
$ ln -s $HOME/riboviz/vignette/input/yeast_YAL_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3
$ cd ../..
$ ls
data vignette
```

In your `example` directory, validate the configuration:

```console
$ nextflow run $HOME/riboviz/prep_riboviz.nf \
    -params-file $HOME/riboviz/vignette/vignette_config.yaml \
    -ansi-log false --validate_only
...
Validated configuration
```

As all the paths in `$HOME/riboviz/vignette/vignette_config.yaml` are relative they are assumed to be relative to the current directory i.e. `example`. You can now run the workflow:

```console
$ nextflow run $HOME/riboviz/prep_riboviz.nf \
    -params-file $HOME/riboviz/vignette/vignette_config.yaml \
    -ansi-log false
```

Our temporary and output files and the Nextflow work directory will all be written to the current directory, `example`:

```console
$ ls
data  vignette  work
$ ls vignette/
index  input  output  tmp
```
